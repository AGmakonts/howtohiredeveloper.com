                <h2>1. Frameworks</h2>
                <div class="description">
                    <p>
                        Frameworks are used as skeletons, on top of which applications are created.
                        This skeleton provides basic functionality and streamlines common tasks, saving a lot of
                        time by providing functionality that is required in every project.
                        This provides consistency and assures that many aspects of the application will be secure and fast.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Almost every programming language has a set of frameworks that are mature and well maintained by open source community.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="explanation">
                    <h3>What is important?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Majority of frameworks that are available in particular programming language will be
                        appropriate for most projects. The most important thing that you need to be aware is that some of
                        the frameworks are no longer maintained. You need to make sure that software that will be
                        used for your application has ongoing support from the community and all security
                        and performance issues are being fixed fast.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keep in mind that each framework is just a tool, nothing more or less. It's not
                        guaranteeing quality of the software that will be created using particular framework.
                        Good developer will know how to use framework to power your application, and how to choose appropriate one.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What to watch for?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Beware of developers that are proposing any framework or technology before knowing exact
                        business requirements for your product. Don't let anyone to force you to think that
                        framework will resolve all issues magically. Once again, it's just a tool and can be
                        used in infinite number of ways.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Should I look for framework experts?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Only if you have large codebase with advanced logic coupled with framework.
                        You should avoid such situations in the first place because framework has nothing to
                        do with business logic for which application is designed. Look for programming
                        experts that know a lot of technologies and can choose right solutions for particular problem.
                    </p>
